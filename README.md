# Distributed Machine Learning with PySpark tutorial

## Instructions

- The code is also available as a [colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1pcJ4QfIvgexD80isjdVRDYcYqY5yNQVo).
- You can run the notebook over the cloud, but I'd recommend to clone this repository and follow the instructions under the "Setup" section of the notebook, to be able to enjoy luxuries like spark UI
- If you don't have Java set up on your machine, please set up java8 (you can follow official docs)
- Finally, for the theoretical part of the tutorial, please refresh your knowledge about Linear regression, Gradient descent, and k-fold cross validation.
